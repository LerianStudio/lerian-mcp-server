# MCP Improvements for Midaz Financial Ledger System

Based on Midaz documentation analysis and current MCP server implementation, this document outlines comprehensive improvements across all MCP feature types: Resources, Prompts, Discovery, Sampling, and Roots.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What We Have (Tools-Only Architecture)
- **16 comprehensive tools** covering organizations → transactions
- **Read-only financial operations** with graceful API fallbacks
- **Complete documentation system** with interactive guides
- **SDK support** for Go/TypeScript with code generation
- **Deployment tools** for local/cloud environments

### 🚨 What We're Missing
- **Resources**: No structured data browsing (48% of MCP clients support this)
- **Prompts**: No template-based workflows (35% of MCP clients support this)
- **Discovery**: No dynamic capability detection (13% of MCP clients)
- **Sampling**: No AI delegation capabilities (6% of MCP clients)
- **Roots**: No workspace/project scoping (5% of MCP clients)
